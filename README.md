This is the main repo of [Obserfy](https://obserfy.com). This repo contains every code that you need to run Obserfy on your own. Obserfy is currently still on its early days. If you were to give it a try, we would love to hear any of your feedback through github issue, or email at chrsep@protonmail.com.

## Vision

**Obserfy aims to empower teachers and schools to provide high-quality education to more children by simplifying and automating as much of their works as possible.** Our software should be fast, simple, and accessible. It should get out of the way of the teachers, allowing them to focus on understanding and planning the education of their students.


## Codebase

### Technologies

- **Golang**: For handling routing and API
- **React**: For web frontend App
- **Typescript**: Typesafe Javascript for frontend
- **Postgres**: Database

### Folder structure

```sh
vor/
|--docker           # Docker config files
    |-- nginx       # Nginx that handles https and frontend caching (optional)
    |-- postgres    # Postgres db for development only
    |-- vor         # Docker image for running Obserfy
|--frontend         # Frontend SPA built on Gatsby
|--pkg              # Routing and APIs using go
|--mailTemplates    # Templates for emails
```

### Backend

Below are a high level overview of the big dependencies that we use for our go powered backend:

- [**go-chi**](https://github.com/go-chi/chi): For handling routing and API
- [**go-pg**](https://github.com/go-pg/pg): ORM for postgres
- [**zap**](https://github.com/uber-go/zap): Fast logging solution
- [**pkg/errors**](https://github.com/pkg/errors): For better error handling
- [**playground/validators**](https://github.com/go-playground/validator): To validate structs
- [**testify**](https://github.com/stretchr/testify): For building test suites

### Frontend

Currently, we are focusing on building a great web experience with PWA support for the client. Below are the tech stack we use for our frontend:

- [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): For building performance optimized SPA/PWA
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/): For the view layer
- [**Typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For type checking
- [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/): For easier development and react component documentations
- **Testing**
  - [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/): For snapshot and unit tests
  - [**Cypress**](https://www.cypress.io/): For e2e test

## Initial setup

### Pre-requisite

To run obserfy for development, you'll need the following tools:

- **Docker**: See [the Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for instructions to install `docker` and `docker-compose`
- **Node:12**: Install node 12, we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to do this, so that you can have multiple node versions on you computer.
- **Yarn V1**: See [yarn's documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) on how to install.

### Setup env

Simply copy the .env.example into .env so that it will be read by docker-compose.

```shell script
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running obserfy

### Docker compose

You'll need to run docker-compose, it will start up every backend service we need for development, such as DB, Nginx, the application server itself, etc. To run docker-compose simply run:

```shell script
docker-compose up -d
```

If you're only modifying the application server codes, this should be enough. It will run the application server code with live reload. It also will run with debugging enabled via [go-delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) on port `40000`. The application server will be serving on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Gatsby development server

To develop the web frontend, you'll need to start the gatsby development server. First go to the frontend folder.

```shell script
cd frontend
```

Then install its dependencies.

```shell script
yarn install
```

Then you'll be able to run gatsby's development server.

```shell script
yarn develop
```

This will start gatsby's development server on `http://localhost:8001`. It will proxy all request to its `/api` and `/auth` routes to the application server on `http://localhost:8000` automatically.
