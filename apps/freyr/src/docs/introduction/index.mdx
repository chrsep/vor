# Intro to Obserfy

Welcome to Obserfy! This documentation can help you to learn more on how to get started with obserfy and how to get the
most out of it.

Obserfy is still in its early days, we really appreciate your feedback so that we can build the best tools for you and
your school. You can post feedback to us here https://feedback.obserfy.com.

## Key Features

Obserfy is an open-source record Montessori keeping software and parent communication tool. We created it
to reduce teacher's administrative burden and help to bridge the communication gap between schools and parents.

Below are the 2 dashboards that we provide for you and its key features.

### Obserfy for Teachers

Teacher's dashboard focuses on improving teacher's productivity. Here can manage all of your school's data that you save
on obserfy.

You can access this dashboard by going to https://app.obserfy.com. Here teachers can:

- Record observations about students
- Plan student's upcoming lessons
- Track student's progress through the Montessori curriculum
- Save pictures of student's activities

### Obserfy for Parents

Parent's dashboard provides a simple, fast, and easy to use interface for parents and guardians to use. This dashboard can
help your school communicate and collaborate with your student's parents/guardians more seamlessly.

You can also use this dashboard to help guide parents in executing lessons for their children at home. They can also report
the result or progress of their children activities back to your school through it too.

This is especially useful during the pandemic where students are required to stay at home most of the time.

You can access this dashboard by going to https://parents.obserfy.com. Here parents/guardians can:

- See observations
- See lesson plans
- Post observations related to the lesson plans
- See photos uploaded by teachers
- Upload their own photos
