# Using Markdown

Markdown is a simple syntax that you can use to format texts. You can do things such as turning texts into bold or
italic, adding headings, adding links and much more.

You can use markdown to format text throughout Obserfy such as on curriculum material descriptions, observation details,
and lesson plan descriptions.

We chose to support markdown because it is easy to learn, easy to implement and its variants been gaining traction across
the web.

## How to use

In obserfy, you can use markdown on text input that have the "Markdown Supported" icon.
